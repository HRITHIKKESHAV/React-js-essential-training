Here, we will learn about the concepts of some of the developer tools in react js. So, primarily we will be installing the react developer tool to chrome
website. Then add that extension to the chrome. After that we can head into the particular website like airbnb and after that we have to press ctrl+shift+j
there we can see the additional components thing based on react.
In the list of extensions found we have to enable the "allow access to the urls" so that we can get that when we are accessing any url.
we can even do on the browsers by just typing "react.new" so this creates the new sandbox page where we can work similar to the vscode.

here similar to the html pages.What we can do here is.
<html>
	<head>
		<title>nothing that important</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>let this be the heading</h1>
	<script type=text/javascript>
		let ul = React.createElement(
		"ul",
		{ style: {color:"blue"}},
		React.createElement("li",null,"save"),
		React.createElement("li",null,"me"),
		React.createElement("li",null,"JSX")
	);
	
	ReactDOM.render(
		ul,
		document.getElementById("root")
	);
	</script>
	</body>
</html>

get to know about babeljs.io where we can paste the not working code and get the output of correctly working
